/* Amzon Interview Question: 31-Jul-2022
 * 
 * You are given a list of packets of varying sizes and there are n channels.

Each of the n channel must have a single packet
Each packet can only be on a single channel
The quality of a channel is described as the median of the packet sizes on that channel.
The total quality is defined as sum of the quality of all channels (round to integer in case of float). 
Given the packets []int32 and channels int32 find the maximum quality.

Example 1:

packets := []int32{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
channels := 2

// Explaination: If packet {1, 2, 3, 4} is sent to channel 1, the median of that channel would be 2.5.
//               If packet {5} is sent to channel 2 its median would be 5. 
//               Total quality would be 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 ~ 8
answer := 8
Example 2:

packets := []int32{5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 3}
channels := 2

// Explaination: Channel 1: {2, 2, 1, 3} (median: 2)
//               Channel 2: {5, 5}       (median: 5)
//               Total Quality : 2 + 5 = 7

// Explaination 2: Channel 1: {5, 2, 2, 1, 3} (median: 2)
//                 Channel 2: {5}             (median: 5)
//                 Total Quality : 2 + 5 = 7
answer := 7
