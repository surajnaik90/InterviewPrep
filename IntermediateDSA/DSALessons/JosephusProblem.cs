/* Given the total number of person n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped 
 * and the kth person is killed in a circle. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle 
 * so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.
 * 
 * For example, if n = 5 and k = 2, then the safe position is 3. Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed,
 * then the person at position 4 is killed, then the person at position 1 is killed. Finally, the person at position 5 is killed.
 * So the person at position 3 survives. 
 * If n = 7 and k = 3, then the safe position is 4. The persons at positions 3, 6, 2, 7, 5, and 1 are killed in order, 
 * and the person at position 4 survives
