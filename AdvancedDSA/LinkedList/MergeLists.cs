/*
Merge two sorted linked lists, A and B, and return it as a new list.

The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists and should also be sorted.

Problem Constraints
0 <= |A|, |B| <= 105

Input Format
The first argument of input contains a pointer to the head of linked list A.

The second argument of input contains a pointer to the head of linked list B.

Output Format
Return a pointer to the head of the merged linked list.

Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 5 -> 8 -> 20
 B = 4 -> 11 -> 15
Input 2:

 A = 1 -> 2 -> 3
 B = Null

Example Output
Output 1:

 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20
Output 2:

 1 -> 2 -> 3

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Merging A and B will result in 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20 
Explanation 2:

 We don't need to merge as B is empty.
